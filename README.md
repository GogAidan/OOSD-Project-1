# OOSD-Project-1
This was our first project as a student of Object Oriented Software Development at SAIT.

This was a simple project, the idea was to create a website for a fake travel agency and add some of our personal flare to it.

I completed this with 3 other team members, it is basic HTML with some added BootStrap CSS and minor Java.
